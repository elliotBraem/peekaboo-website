Amanda is a pediatric occupational therapist and the owner of Peek-A-Boo Pediatric Therapy LLC. She graduated with her bachelor's degree in Psychology at St. Ambrose University in Davenport, Iowa in 2006 and with her Master's degree in Occupational Therapy at St. Ambrose University in Davenport, Iowa in 2007. She was inspired to pursue occupational therapy from two family members; one with Cerebral Palsy and the other with sensory processing disorder.

She worked in the Chicagoland area from 2007-2012, then, in 2013, she moved to Colorado and was inspired to open Peek-A-Boo Pediatric Therapy LLC. She has experience working in a variety of settings but has had a passion toward supporting children from birth-3 through the early intervention program. She also has enjoyed creating and teaching education courses for therapists and parents. (The Pediatric Brain through Summit Professional Education, the webinar: Helping vs. Hindering your Child: A Parent's Guide to Sensory-Motor Development for Infants and Toddlers through the STAR Institute for Sensory Processing Disorder and webinars through the international company, Upbility).

Amanda has advanced trainings in sensory integration, including 120 hours to obtain the Sensory Integration and Praxis Test Certification (SIPT). She has training in Neurodevelopmental Treatment (NDT), Constraint Induced Movement Therapy (CIMT), Neuromuscular Re-Education Stimulation (NMES) and Assistive Technology including low tech to high tech devices able to assess a child's ability to access functional expressive and written communication through technology. She earned an endorsement through Colorado Association for Infant Mental Health and is an Infant-Mental Health Specialist and has thoroughly enjoyed supporting babies who have just been discharged from the NICU to home.

When she is not working Amanda enjoys finding balance with sipping on coffee, going to cycle and hiit classes, music, spending time with her husband, daughter and dog.
