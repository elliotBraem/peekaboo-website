Hello, my name is Kayla Culbertson! I am an occupational therapist at Peek-A-Boo Pediatric Therapy in Colorado. I earned my doctorate degree in Occupational Therapy from the University of Toledo and my bachelor of science degree in Psychology from Wayne State University. Prior to starting my journey with Peek-A-Boo, I worked as an occupational therapist at Childrenâ€™s Hospital of Michigan Specialty Center.

I began my journey in the pediatric world because of the enjoyment and excitement I find in working with children. I have a passion for working with children and their families to aid in improving their quality of life! I love working with infants on bottle feeding and helping them transition to table foods as they grow and develop. In addition to traditional feeding skills, I also enjoy helping children and their families find enjoyment in the feeding experience that may be stressful or overwhelming for them. I love to work with babies and toddlers who have developmental delays. I like to assess their strengths, their needs, and create the best developmental approach to make strides in their development; including identifying additional specialists as needed. I enjoy problem solving to figure out why babies and children have sensory processing difficulties, specifically with interoception. I like to help guide the families on the best treatment plan to help their child and family get the best results. I have also enjoyed working with babies, toddlers, and children with neurological impairments such as hydrocephalus, brachial plexus injuries, CVAs (strokes), hypotonia, hypertonia, etc.

Outside of work I enjoy spending time with my husband and our dog, Jaxson, our family, and friends. I enjoy working out, playing sports, and spending time outdoors.
