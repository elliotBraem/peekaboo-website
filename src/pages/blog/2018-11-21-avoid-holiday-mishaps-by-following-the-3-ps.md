As the holidays quickly approach it’s not uncommon for our schedules to quickly fill with various commitments often involving parties, dinners, and gatherings with family and friends. Make sure to keep these events enjoyable for every member of the family with these 3 quick tips!

 

_Prepare:_ Children make sense of their environment with the assistance of routine and consistency, help build their confidence by preparing them for each event. In the weeks or days leading up to an event (maybe its Thanksgiving dinner at Grandma’s or a family holiday party) discuss where you’ll be going with your little one. Talk about where it will be (Uncle Joe’s house, Aunt Sally’s farm) and make sure to include some fun details (We’ll have time to go see the ducks, or Grandma will have your favorite brownies!) that your child can expect to encounter at the event. Talking about the event with your child will build anticipation and help her know what to expect which will give her some authority in this unfamiliar routine.

_Play:_ Not all gatherings over the holiday season are centered on play for your child. Does your child like coloring or playdough? Great! Bring some along. Will there be other children there? If so, you may need to initiate play with the other children. Help them by building a tower with legos or taking turns feeding or dressing baby doll before leaving them to find the hors devours. Is there a place where the adults can mingle and the kids can play outside? Help them get some energy out in the fresh air! Everyone will enjoy themselves more if they’re able to pass the time with fun and engaging play!

_Prevent_: Prevent a tantrum or meltdown by reading your child’s cues of when he has had enough. Is he yawning excessively? Rubbing his eyes? Becoming more irritable or fussy and less able to be comforted? Is she shying away from being held by others and running to you to “hide?” Is she becoming very excited and jumping/crashing into furniture? These can all be cues that your child has had their fill and is ready to go home. Parties and gatherings can be very fun, but may also be overstimulating. By clueing in on these cues everyone can leave happy!

 

Keep these 3 P’s in mind to help make these special occasions fun for everyone!
