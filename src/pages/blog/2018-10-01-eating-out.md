Back to school can bring lots of nerves and excitement for both kids and their parents, but it can also mean a very busy schedule! If back to school routines leave you finding yourself wanting to eat out more often because of the time needed for meal prep, nightly dinner ideas, and packing school lunches seems daunting, know you’re not alone! Eating in a restaurant can be a great way to encourage social interaction during meal time and maybe even try some new foods. However, if dining in a restaurant with your youngsters leaves you feeling anxious because he/she “can’t sit still” or “has a meltdown every time we go out to eat” then keep reading for a few quick tips for a more successful dining out experience for both you and your little ones!

1. _Pick a time to practice._ If you notice your child is particularly sensitive to sights or sounds, going to a restaurant at a less busy time of day such as slightly before or after the lunch or dinner “rush” may help elicit a better overall experience for the whole family. Being mindful of the time of day and place will ultimately set the stage for a positive learning experience for you and your child.
2. _Sight._ Going out to eat is a learning experience for children! It’s a great opportunity to talk about new or different foods that you may not normally have at home. Give them a way to be a part of the action such as choosing a restaurant where they can see the food being made right in front of them such as Chipotle, Qdoba, etc. This is also a great opportunity to get them in on the decision making process by modeling your decisions first. Your child will see and hear the food you order. This gives your child the opportunity to rehearse what they want to select. PRACTICE giving your child options of what they would like to eat such as choosing between chicken or pork, or cheese and tomatoes. Children feel more in control when they are able to make choices and you may find they are more inclined to actually eat their meal!
3. _Helper!_ After you’ve made it through the ordering process, this is a great opportunity for your child to be a helper. Allow him or her to be mom or dad’s helper and carry the tray, napkins, silverware, etc. to the table. If you have more than one child, you can give each child an item to carry to the table. This is a great way to keep them focused on a task and give them a sense of accomplishment for helping as well.
4. _Options, options, options._ If possible, allow your child to choose which table to sit at. If it is a busy time of day and there are very few options, let him or her choose between two tables, or if that is not an option, allow them to choose which seat they sit in for the meal.
5. _Engage._ When you do inevitably end up at a restaurant with a longer wait time, engage your child in a fun social game to pass the time. Mealtime is a great way for you and your child or family to connect. Take this time to talk with your children at the table since you are not having to actively prepare the food. This is a great time to talk about and label colors you see in the restaurant such as on the floor, the walls, etc. Counting objects on the table, coloring (many restaurants offer crayons and paper if you ask!), or playing “I Spy” are all great ways to engage your child while waiting to fill those grumbling tummies!
6. _Time._ Lastly, keep in mind that little bodies need to move, so attempt to keep your dining experiences to under an hour. Most children under the age of three get squirmy when sitting for more than 20-30 minutes. This is especially true when they have already finished eating and may be distracted by loud voices, sights, or sounds within the restaurant environment.

Hopefully these tips make your next eating out experience a fun experience the whole family can enjoy!
