_Are you wondering what Thanksgiving foods your baby can eat? Consider their motor development:_

Supported sitter(sits on the floor, holds body up by propping on arms): single fruit or vegetable smooth purees

- Choose one vegetable or fruit from your meal and blend it into a smooth puree/stage one food (sweet potatoes, pumpkin, green beans, cooked apples). For the consistency, aim for totally smooth and almost runny puree, like yogurt.

 

Independent sitter (sits on the floor and is able to use their hands to play without falling): combination smooth purees

- Choose one or two vegetables or fruits and blend them into a puree/ stage two food (sweet potatoes, pumpkin, green beans, cooked apples). For the consistency, aim for a totally smooth texture, like pudding or hummus.

Crawler & Cruiser on furniture: Foods that dissolve in your mouth, soft mashed table foods

- Crackers, graham crackers
- Mashed potatoes, grits, pumpkin pie filling, sweet potato pie filling, pasta without sauce, overcooked squash, avocado, vegetable soup ingredients without the broth, steamed peas. Keep chunk sizes to less than ¼” and soft enough that you can squash them with your finger.

Walker: Soft table foods, mixed texture foods

- Well cooked meats, cheese bites, steamed vegetable pieces, soft fruit
- Pudding corn, stuffing, apple pie filling, mac and cheese

 

Happy holidays and happy eating!
