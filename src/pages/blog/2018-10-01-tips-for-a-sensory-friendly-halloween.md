Halloween and more specifically, trick or treating, can be a stress provoking time for parents and our children with sensory differences. If your child has a sensitivity to new or loud sounds, sights, smells, or avoidance to certain textures, it is still possible to have a fun and safe Halloween experience! Keep these ideas in mind to build a sense of confidence for your child as Halloween approaches.

1. _Talk about it!_ Start talking with your child or children about the upcoming holiday. The earlier the better. In the weeks and days leading up to the big event, try to include all the senses when discussing Halloween with your little ones. Talk about what they may see (do you decorate your home for the holiday?). Pumpkins, skeletons, leaves, etc. are all common place objects they may encounter leading up to and during this holiday. Try incorporating a children’s book or a children’s YouTube video on the topic to further engage their interest. What smells may be different? Candy, cookies, incense, candles can trigger different emotions in our little ones. What will their costume feel like? What fabrics is it made of and are they comfortable touching various textures if you plan to take your child trick or treating? Talk about sounds they may hear such as electronic lawn ornaments and excited voices of other children. Does your child have an aversion to certain tastes or textures or any allergies? Be sure to keep these in mind leading up to the event. Letting him or her know they do not have to taste any of the candy or treats if they don’t feel like it. _Books that may be of interest:_

    - Little Blue Truck's Halloween
2. _Try it on!_ You’ve searched high and low and have finally found the perfect costume, but they won’t even touch it, let alone put it on. Talking with your child about the costume can help build understanding and possibly excitement. If your child is very hesitant begin by letting them lead the way by touching it with their hands and working up to trying it on a few times leading up to the day. Talk with them about where or why it feels uncomfortable and make adjustments so they feel most comfortable. If it’s itchy, have a barrier (such as a favorite shirt) between the itchy fabric and their skin. If it is too hot, exchange for a larger size for some breathing room or select a different costume with breathable fabric.
3. _Practice!_ Practice with your child what they will say when trick or treating. How should they address the adults, will they be saying “trick or treat”? If so, siblings, friends, and even the dog make great practice partners! Have your child practice by knocking on a bedroom door, or set up a game of “hide and seek” while wearing your costumes.

Hoping you and your family a fun and safe Halloween!
