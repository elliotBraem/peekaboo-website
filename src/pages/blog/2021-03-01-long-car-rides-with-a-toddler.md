Long car rides can be difficult for everyone, especially your toddler. It can be tempting to turn on a tablet, phone, or TV screen to entertain them and make that car ride easier. But, …

Here are some fun activities that you can do with your two-year-old during long car rides instead!

1. I spy - You and your child can make “binoculars” out of toilet paper roll tubes and take the binoculars along.
2. Sing and dance along songs (e.g., Wheels on the Bus)
3. Books
4. Mess-free sensory bag - Place water beads, dish soap, shaving cream, jello, or non-toxic paint into a durable zip-loc bag that has been glued shut (you may want to double bag the contents in a second zip-loc bag to prevent any spillage in the car). You can then tape the bag to the window or a tray for your child to play with. Click here for a variety of examples: https://handsonaswegrow.com/48-sensory-bags-roundup/
5.  Sensory bottles - Remember to glue the bottle shut before you give the bottle to your child to play with. Click here for some examples: https://preschoolinspirations.com/how- to-make-a-perfect-sensory-bottle/.
6. Magnets - Grab a metal cooking sheet and some fun magnets for your kiddo to play with (be sure the magnets are not a choking hazard).
7. Magnadoodle – Your child can color, and you won’t need to worry about a mess or losing any crayons or markers in the car.
8. Homemade Velcro matching book – Click here for an example: https://www.teachinglittles.com/how-to-make-a-quiet-book-or-busy-binder-for-toddlers- and-preschool-kids/
9. Reusable gel window clings (be sure the gel window clings are not a choking hazard)
10. Stringing large beads - If you don’t have a lace and large beads, you can use a shoelace and cut empty toilet paper rolls or paper towel rolls into smaller 1-2 inch “beads”. Make a small hole in one of the “beads” and tie the shoelace to it, in order to create a “stopper”, so your child can successfully string the beads (be sure an adult is able to closely supervise the child with the activity to prevent any choking hazards).
11. Imagination vehicle – Give your child a plastic plate that they can use to pretend that they’re driving during the car trip. You can also make a pretend steering wheel with your child beforehand to bring along on the car trip.
12. Counting games – Count how many items you see while driving along (e.g., cars, motorcycles, clouds, trees, houses, etc.).

There are also things you can do with your toddler outside of riding in the car to improve their ability to cooperate with long car rides.

- Swinging at the park or at home in a blanket
- Sliding
- Magic carpet rides (i.e., pulling your toddler around while they sit on a blanket)
- Riding in a stroller
- Spinning activities (e.g., Ring Around the Rosie, Sit and Spin, etc.)
- Log rolls in the grass
