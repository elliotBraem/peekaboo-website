January can be a cold and snowy month that often keeps us cooped up inside. This can be tough for both parents AND kids as we quickly run out of things to do! Here’s a list of 31 ideas to keep your child busy each day this month! Feel free to print out the blank calendar to plan out your activities, or even add your own!

 

1. Make a fort in your child’s bedroom or the living room with blankets and pillows.
2. Let your child raid your closet and put on a fashion show.
3. Bake cookies or treats and have your child help by kneading the dough or rolling the cookies.
4. Make your own instruments using items around the house such as a large serving spoon and pot, or small container filled halfway with beans and cue the band.
5. Stomp or pop bubble wrap.
6. Break out the Play-Doh or whip up a batch of your own using 2 cups of flour, 1 cup of salt and 1 cup of water.
7. Build an indoor obstacle course using pillows, a pop up tunnel, chairs, and rugs.
8. Visit the Denver Art Museum-kids 18 and under are free!
9. Bundle up and head outside to build a snowman.
10. Head to your local library. Most libraries offer a free story time, a small play area, and some puzzles.
11. Fill up a bucket with soapy water and have your child run his play cars through the “car wash” or give his animals or dolls a bath.
12. No mess finger paint. Fill a Ziploc bag with a few different colors of paint, close tightly, and tape to the table or a cookie sheet for stability and have your child “paint” by sliding her fingers across the bag to spread.
13. Fill ice cube trays or circular molds with Jell-O, let them set until firm and then bring them out in a tub or on a tray and let then sensory play begin.
14. Homemade scented rice bin. Place uncooked white rice into small Ziploc bags, add food coloring and shake to distribute coloring. Add natural scents with essential oils or pantry staples such as cinnamon into each bag for desired scent and shake. Leave bags open and shake every few hours until dry. Place into bowls or containers and offer scoops, utensils, or cups with rice for fun sensory play.
15. Visit the Children’s Museum.
16. “Paint” with shaving cream in the bathtub.
17. Make your own sensory bottle using a leftover plastic bottle and adding any dried item like pasta or rice for a noise maker, or adding water and clear glue and glitter. Make sure to secure lid tightly with super or hot glue before giving to your child.
18. Cook spaghetti noodles until al dente (very firm) and then add food coloring to dye to desired colors. Allow to cool and dry before placing into containers for a fun sensory experience.
19. Make an “I Spy” Bottle. Fill a plastic bottle with uncooked rice and fill with up to 10 small items such as a candle, dice, crayon, paper clip, jingle bell, marble, etc. Secure the lid. Make a list and have your child shake and roll bottle to find each item. Check off each item as they go.
20. Have your child help cook a meal with you. They can be in charge of stirring, spreading, or adding ingredients. This is an excellent way to get your child involved with meal time.
21. Provide mini marshmallows and toothpicks and let your child’s imagination soar. You could start by building shapes, letters, or a house!
22. Have an indoor picnic. Pack a lunch just like you would if you were headed outside or to the park, spread your blanket out and enjoy.
23. Make edible jewelry. Use shoestring licorice and any food that has holes in it such as cheerios, fruit loops, pretzels, or apple rings.
24. Make maracas. You’ll need two paper plates, ¼-1/2 cup of dried beans, and tape. Encourage your child to color on the plates. Place the beans on one of the paper plates, top with the other plate facing down. Tape together and shake!
25. Sponge painting. Have your child help you cut different textures and sizes of sponges into a variety of shapes. Dip into paint and stamp or spread onto paper or cardboard.
26. Fill bucket with water throw in some Legos, letters, or ping pong balls and encourage your child to get them out using tweezers or tongs.
27. Make edible Play-Doh. Combine 1 cup creamy peanut butter and 1.5-2 cups cornstarch. Use cookie cutters and a rolling pin to mold into various shapes.
28. Mix spices with white washable paint such as cinnamon, turmeric, paprika, pepper, etc. for a fun twist. Use paint brushes or fingers to spread the paint.
29. Tape a piece or two of sand paper to the table and provide crayons for your child. Watch them explore this new coloring surface.
30. Punch holes in toilet paper roll and “string” straws through the holes for a fun fine motor activity.
31. Make a colorful pom pom drop using toilet paper tubes. Tape toilet paper or paper towel tubes to the wall and encourage your child to explore the activity by dropping pom poms down the tubes. For a child who is beginning to match and sort by color, consider coloring each tube and having them place only that color into each one.

As always be sure to closely monitor your child during these activities. Have fun and happy creating!
