Colds easily spread from adults, siblings, and/or neighbors and often leave us feeling groggy and unmotivated. This is often how are children are feeling when they come down with a cold as well.

Have you noticed your child lacking motivation to learn new skills? Or show off a new skill a few times and then not repeat it again? This can be common when your child is hit with a cold. Let’s take a look at a few ideas to keep your little one on track this winter season!

 

_Decrease the Spread of Germs_

1. Wash hands thoroughly and often! Sing the ABC’s, count aloud, or hum a tune with your little one while washing to sustain their interest.
2. Stay home if you or your child are feeling under the weather. The winter season can be filled with many get togethers, but make sure you’re all feeling healthy.
3. Wash or sanitize clothing or toys between uses that have been with your child while out and about. This can decrease their chance of bringing germs into your home during play.

Getting sick can happen even if you are very diligent throughout the winter season. Unfortunately, this may mean your child may show a decrease in energy while combatting the cold which may translate to stalled or a mini regression of skills during this time. Set your child up for success by trying these strategies while the cold is running its course.

 

1. Be sure to keep your little one on his or her normal schedule during this time as much as possible. This includes both day and nighttime routines. Lack of sleep AND a cold can be really hard to manage. Keeping to his/her normal schedule will help maintain some normalcy during this time.
2. When your child is feeling well enough during the day be sure to encourage play time, but don’t push her if she isn’t feeling up to it. Offering times for play will provide continued learning and skill progression, rather than allowing him to “veg out” on t.v. shows or Ipad games.
3. Sleep can be difficult when fighting off a cold so be sure to make time for lots of rest and/or naps.
4. Monitor your child's temperature. If  your child has a fever or green/brown discharge from her nose make sure to cancel appointments and therapy session to decrease the spread of germs.

 

Always check in with your child’s pediatrician if you have concerns regarding your child’s health or skill progression. Here’s to a happy and healthy winter season!
