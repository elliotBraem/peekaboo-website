_Thanksgiving is just around the corner. Thanksgiving is a time for family, tradition, and food. Here’s some ideas to set your baby or toddler up for success this holiday season’s meals._

Get your baby or toddler ready:

- Don’t be afraid to let your child get messy - mess is how children explore new foods. To help keep things clean, you can try eating outside (if weather allows), putting a plastic table cloth under your child’s high chair, or put the high chair somewhere that is easier to clean (hardwood vs carpet). You can also get a washable smock for your child to wear while eating, leaving their Thanksgiving day attire intact after the meal.
- If you’re preparing foods before the big day, get your child involved by letting them help. They could help stir, pour, taste test, or even just watch!

 

During the meal:

- If you have a picky eater, try putting only 1-2 new foods on their plate along with foods you know they’ll like.
- Set a good example for your children – they love to copy their parents. Show them with your own behavior how to try a wide variety of foods, how to sit at the meal without distraction, and how to remain calm about any messes that might occur.
- Unplug – no iPad or phone at the dinner table.
- Try to keep your baby’s meal short – about 20 minutes.
- When talking about your meal, use some positive descriptive words with your child. Talk about how new or less-preferred foods are crunchy, spicy, colorful, or chewy.
- When putting food on your child’s plate, you could give them a chance to have some input by letting them choose a spot for each new food to go on their plate. You could also try using a plate with a decoration on it, to encourage them to eat their food to see what’s underneath.

After dinner:

- Save leftovers for practicing – it takes kids 20 times with each new food before they decide they like it!

 

Happy Thanksgiving to you and yours!
