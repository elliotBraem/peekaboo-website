Lara is very passionate about working with children. She graduated with a bachelor’s degree from Bryn Mawr College in Psychology in 2013 and with a Master’s of Science of Occupational Therapy degree from Thomas Jefferson University in 2015.

She has a background in working with children of all ages. She is excited about integrating therapy into her clients’ homes, as she truly believes in the benefits of fully incorporating families and routines into therapy. During her education, Lara had several specialized internships and clinical rotations working with children of all ages in Autism Spectrum Disorder specific classrooms. Her work and educational experiences have inspired her to pursue early intervention, where she feels she can best focus her interest in sensory integration and behavior interventions to best help her clients.

When she is not seeing families on her caseload, Lara enjoys riding her horse, fostering animals, running, and spending time outdoors.
