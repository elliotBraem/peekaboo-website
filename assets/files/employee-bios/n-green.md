Nicki is an occupational therapist that earned her bachelors degree from the University of Nebraska-Kearney in psychology and Spanish. She earned her Doctorate in Occupational Therapy from the University of South Dakota.

Nicki is passionate about providing services in homes where she can adapt strategies to meet a family’s unique atmosphere and routines. This parallels with the Early Intervention model. She loves seeing children play and interact with their family. She is excited to think outside of the box when integrating therapeutic strategies and how they can be built into a child’s everyday life. She enjoys working with children with sensory processing differences, Autism spectrum, feeding challenges, and motor planning difficulties.

When she is not providing OT services, Nicki enjoys running, hiking, and spending time with her friends and family.
