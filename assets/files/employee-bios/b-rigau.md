Briana graduated from the University of Colorado Denver with a Bachelor of Science in Biology
and Psychology. While earning her undergraduate degree, she discovered and fell in love with
the field of occupational therapy. She earned her Master of Science in Occupational Therapy, as
well as her Doctor of Occupational Therapy degrees from the University of Illinois at Chicago
(UIC).

Briana loves working with children and their families in their natural environments to help them
meet their unique goals and participate in the things they need and want to do every day. She
enjoys thinking on her feet to support families in discovering and utilizing strategies that work
best for them. Briana is particularly passionate about family-centered care, as well as research
engagement within early intervention.

When Briana isnâ€™t working as a pediatric occupational therapist, she enjoys skiing, practicing
yoga, listening to music, and spending time with her loved ones.
