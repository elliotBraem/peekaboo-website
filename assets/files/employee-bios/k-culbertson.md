Hello, my name is Kayla Culbertson! I am an occupational therapist at Peek A Boo Therapy in Colorado. I graduated from Wayne State University earning my bachelor of science degree in Psychology. I then graduated from the University of Toledo earning my doctorate degree in Occupational Therapy.

I began my journey in the pediatric world because of the enjoyment and excitement I find in working
with children. I have a passion for working with children and their families to aid in improving their quality of life!

Outside of work I enjoy spending time with my husband and our dog, Jaxson, our family, and friends. I
enjoy working out, playing sports, and spending time outdoors.
