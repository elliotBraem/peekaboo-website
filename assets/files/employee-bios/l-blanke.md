Lindsey comes to Peek-A-Boo Pediatric Therapy from Wisconsin. She graduated with her Bachelorâ€™s degree from University of Minnesota - Twin-Cities. After graduating, she was inspired to pursue the occupational therapy field and earned her Masters of Occupational Therapy from Mount Mary University.

Her motivation was to become a pediatric occupational therapist. She has a strong interest in sensory integration and how it impacts not only the child, but also their family.

"Working with birth to 3-year-olds in their home has been an enjoyable setting as it allows me to integrate activities for families to use every day!"

When she is not seeing families on her caseload, she enjoys hiking and camping with her husband and dog. She spends her free time exploring all that Colorado has to offer.
